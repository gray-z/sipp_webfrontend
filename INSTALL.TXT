INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Requirements:
- LAMP Environement (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP)
- at least 0.5MB free disk space ;)
- a valid MYSQL user with privileges to create a database and tables
- write access in or beneath apache's www subfolder, or at least one of its
  subfolders (directly or via FTP, SSH ...)
- at least one version of SIPp installed

Installation:
	1. Download SIPp Webfrontend from sipp.sourceforge.net
	2. Unzip the downloaded file and...
	3. upload the contents of the src folder onto your webserver using
	   ftp, ssh etc.
	4. Copy the files in a subfolder of apaches  www directory, say 
	   /var/www/sipp-webfrontend/ .
	5. Now create a mysql database named SIPpDB (if you choose another
	   database name, change the attribute db_name in the config.ini.php
	   file accordingly). To achieve this you have either direct access
	   to Mysql via shell, or you use a tool like phpMyAdmin.
	   Note that if you use phpMyAdmin, you need the necessary per-
	   missions to create databases and tables. 
	   Via shell, type 
		mysql -u <username> -p
	   where <username> is your valid Mysql user. 
	   Now write
		CREATE DATABASE SIPpDB;
		USE SIPpDB;
		\. /var/www/sipp-webfrontend/tables.sql
		quit
	   to create the database and the tables and exit (instead of 
	   /var/www/sipp-webfrontend/ enter the path to your SIPp webfolder).
	6. For the tool to work, you need at least one version of SIPp
	   installed on the server. If this is not the case, do it now. You
	   can download SIPp at sipp.sourceforge.net. SIPp Webfrontend 
	   assumes that each version of the sipp command line tool has the
	   name sipp. Thus if you want to use different versions of SIPp, it
	   is important that they are located in different folders under the
	   name sipp. Let us assume that you have now installed 2 versions
	   under /usr/bin/sipp2.0/sipp and /usr/bin/sipp3.0/sipp.
	7. Now edit the config file config.ini.php. You can find information
	   about its structure and parameters in the config file itself.
	   In the [EXECUTABLES] section enter a line for each installed
	   version of SIPp. In our case it should look like that:
		[EXECUTABLES]
		; Specify the absolute paths to the SIPp executables using
		; the syntax: version_number = path
		; The first occurrence of such a line, defines the default
		; version. At least one version is mandatory.
		2.0 = "/usr/bin/sipp2.0/sipp"
		3.0 = "/usr/bin/sipp3.0/sipp"
	   Further in the [CONFIG] section adjust the attributes
		db_host = "localhost"        ;in most cases the webserver
					     ;and the database server are
					     ;on the same machine, in this
					     ;case leave "localhost"
		db_user = "someuser"         ;valid Mysql user
		db_pwd = "somepwd"           ;valid password of the Mysql
					     ;user
		db_name = "SIPpDB"           ;only change this if you chose
					     ;a different database name in
					     ;step 5
		admin_pwd = "secret"         ;specify a password for the
					     ;admin area of the web front-
					     ;end, leave it blank if you
					     ;don't want password authenti-
					     ;cation
